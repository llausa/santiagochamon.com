	<p>The purpose of this project was to help me expand my technical skills in web development. I did all the planning, design, front-end and back-end by myself. Of course the internet has to receive credit for guiding me and clearing my queries throughout the project. This was the first project I did where there was no tutorial for what I wanted to achieve. Thus I surprised even myself in how far I came. It goes to show that with a little bit of planning and hard work you can create anything. I only came to have real problems during deployment. The site is now online and you can find the code through the button below.</p>

	<p>This is my very first website made entirely from scratch. In order to learn how to do this I read <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Michael Hartl</a> and watched Mackenzie Child's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL23ZvcdS3XPK9Y4DRU-BiJtiY5L_QhUUq" target="_blank">Ruby, RoR and Design Tutorials</a>. You should check them out! This is a personal page and includes a contact form and a portfolio of projects.</p>

	Programming as a System
</h2>
<br>
<p class="wrapper">
	According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1491518855" target="_blank">Scott Adams</a>, goals are for losers. What one needs is a system. Something you do every day that increases  your odds of long term happiness and success. This means that I strive to program every day. Why? I want to create useful technology that people can use. There are many things out there that I would like to see which don't yet exist. I am taking this opportunity to solve some of my own problem and also provide value to people around the world. This is also a great way to solidify my skill in programming.

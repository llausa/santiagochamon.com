	Programming as a System
</h2>
<br>
<p class="wrapper">
	According to Scott Adams, goals are for losers. What one needs is a system. Something you do every day that increases long term happiness. This means that I will strive to program every day. Why? I want to create useful applications that people can use. There are many things out there that I would like to see which don't yet exist. I am taking this opportunity to solve some of my own problem and also provide value to people around the world. This is also a great way to solidify my skill in programming.

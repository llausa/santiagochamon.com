	<p>For my second project I decided to create an app that has many cities available and allows people to post cool experiences there. Hence the name explorecities.io. This was a technically challenging project for me. Nothing I wanted to achieve had a tutorial on it so I had to do a lot of learning and figuring-out myself.</p>

This is the README File for santiagochamon.com!

This site was created by the man himself on 27/12/16.

Santiagochamon.com marks the beginning of a new era.

It is the very first web application created by Santiago Chamon utilizing the Ruby on Rails framework.

The code may be amateurish but it signals the first step in a journey that will span many decades.

This README was written on the third person by Santiago.

Lol.
